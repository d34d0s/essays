# r3shape / essays

This repo collects technical essays, notes, and research written as part of the ongoing development of r3shape — an organization focused on building flexible, low-level tools and systems.

Each essay is written in Markdown, version-controlled, and intended as both a personal archive and public reference. Writing these is part of a broader process: study deeply, build deliberately, and document the ideas that shape the work.

## About r3shape

r3shape is an organization focused on building foundational tools for developers, with an emphasis on clarity, extensibility, and simplicity.

Current projects include:

- **r3make** — a lightweight, JSON-configured CLI build tool for C (written in Python, v2025.1.8)
- **koncept** — a graphics engine targeting OpenGL with DirectX, and Vulkan support planned
- **corex** — a modular runtime library offering APIs for memory, math, generics, file I/O, ECS, data structures, and more

The essays in this repo often trace the research, experiments, and ideas that inform these tools.
